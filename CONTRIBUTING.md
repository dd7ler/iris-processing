## Contributing to IRIS-Processing
You can take a look at the [Issues](http://github.com/dd7ler/iris-processing/issues"Issues") documentation, to get an idea of what people are working on right now.

## Getting Started
Right now, this project is entirely in MATLAB 2013b
* Make sure you have MATLAB 2013b (or higher) installed on your machine.
* Make sure you have a GitHub account
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

 *If you are a contributor already, you don't need to fork the project - just start a new branch for your issue under the dev branch if there isn't one already! :)*

## Testing
We love tests! If you can think of a way to test the functionality you are trying to add or fix, write that first. That way, we can (a) compare different solutions quantitatively, and (b) know when a solution is good enough to be selected.
